			<h3><i class="fas fa-map-maker-alt"></i>Ahemdabad</h3>
			<p>Declared as India's first UNESCO World Heritage City, Ahmedabad or Amdavad is steeped in history and tradition. Offering a seamless blend of spectacular architecture of centuries-old mosques and contemporary avant-garde design, Gujarat's biggest city is a bustling cosmopolitan hub. Ahmedabad is divided into two parts, cut into distinct sections by the Sabarmati river. On the eastern bank of the river stands the quaint old quarter, which is marked by winding lanes throbbing with tradition and culture, and on the western side is the sprawling new town that has created a niche for itself with world-class urban planning. Add to this a vibrant array of street-food and colourful bazaars, and Ahmedabad becomes a tourist hub where one would be spoilt for choices.</p>

			<h3><i class="fas fa-map-maker-alt"></i>Vadodara</h3>
			<p>Vadodara, Gujarat's third largest city, is situated on the banks of the river Vishwamistri and is famous as the cultural capital of Gujarat as well as a centre of educational activities. 
        Vadodara was originally known as Vadapradaka, which means a village amidst Banyan trees. Archaeological findings show that there was human habitation here from pre-historic times. Vadodara passed through the hands of the Imperial Guptas, Chalukyas, Rashtrakutas, Solankis, Sultans of Delhi, the Mughals and finally the Marathas. Present day Vadodara owes its grandeur to Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III, a great ruler, a socio-economic reformer, a patron of arts, architecture and music. It was he who visualized the development of Vadodara. Today Vadodara is a city of palaces, gardens and industrial giants.</p>

			<h3><i class="fas fa-map-maker-alt"></i>Kutch</h3>
			<p>Centuries-old traditions wrapped with spectacular nature define the Kutch region in Gujarat. A large part of this district is known as the Rann of Kutch which is shallow wetland which submerges in water during the rainy season and becomes dry during other seasons.

The district is also famous for the ecologically important Banni grasslands with their seasonal marshy wetlands which form the outer belt of the Rann of Kutch.
        Kutch District is surrounded by the Gulf of Kutch and the Arabian Sea in the south and west, while the northern and eastern parts are surrounded by the Great and Little Rann  of  Kutch. The walled city of Bhuj is the headquarters of the Kutch district.</p>
